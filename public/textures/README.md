# Wall texture (optional)

To use a **photo-based concrete wall texture**:

1. Add a tilable image here named **`concrete-wall.jpg`** (or `concrete-wall.png`).
2. Use a seamless/tilable texture so edges match when repeated (e.g. 512×512 or 1024×1024).
3. The site will tile it and apply a dark tint to match the gallery theme.

**Free sources for concrete textures:**
- [CC0 Textures – Concrete](https://cc0textures.com/c/concrete) (seamless options)
- [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/textures) (CC0, high quality)
- [AmbientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) (CC0)

If no image is present, a procedural texture is used instead.
